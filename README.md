# Memory Matching Game

This is a browser-based card matching game that tests the player's memory and quickness. The deck of cards features badges of primary schools built in Uganda by Building Tomorrow, the game creator's employer.

## How to Play:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying school badge.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the other card in the deck with a matching badge.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
* The fewer moves the player takes to match all the cards, the more stars they earn.
